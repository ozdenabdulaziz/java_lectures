class starts at 10:10 am

Warmup tasks:
	1.  write a program that asks user to enter 5 numbers and retuns the maximum number

	2.  write a program that asks user to enter 5 numbers and returns the minimum number

	3. write a program that asks user to enter 5 numbers and returns the minimum and maximum numbers

	4. write a program that can divide two numbers without using / & % operators and retuns the devision and remainder

			ex:
				input:  10
						3

				0utput: 
						3 with a remainder of 1

				10 / 3 = 3.3333....

				10 - 3 = 7
				7 - 3 = 4
				4 - 3 = 1

				3 times subtraction, numerator at the end is 1



				19 / 2

				19 - 2 = 17;
				17 - 2 = 15;
				15 - 2 = 13;
				13 - 2 = 11;
				11 - 2 = 9;
				9 - 2 = 7;
				7 - 2 = 5;
				5 > 2 = 3
				3 - 2 = 1;

				9 times execution, numerator is 1

				result: 9 with a remainder of 1


	5. write a program that can multiply two numbers without using *

		5 * 3 = 15

		5 + 5 + 5
