Warmup tasks:
	1. Write a program that will print out all alphabet letters
	        
	2. Write a program that will print out all alphabet letters in backwards

	3. write a program that can calculate the sum of 5 user entered inputs

	4. write a program that can calculate the sum of all numbers between 1 to any given number
	        ex:
	            input: 100
	            output: 5050

	            input: 50
	            output: 1275
	            

	5. write a program that can reverse any given string
			ex:
				input: abcd
				output: dcba

				input: Cybertek
				output: ketrebyC


	6. write a program that can verify if the user entered String is palindrome

			ex:
				input: Level
				output: Level is palindrome

				input: java
				output: java is not palindrome


for loop: stops execution when condition is false

	
	for(initialization; condition; iterator ){

	}


	initialization: starts

	condition; end

	iterator: makes the condition false eventually



loops without curly braces:	Can only repeat one statement

break: used for exiting switch and loop
