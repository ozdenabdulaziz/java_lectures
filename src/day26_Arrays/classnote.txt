Package name: day26_Arrays

Warmup tasks:
	FrequencyOfEachChars
	1. write a program that can return the frequency of characters from a String
			Ex:
				str = "ababaac";

				output:
					a3b2c1


	2. write a program that can return the maximum number from an array of integers

	3. write a program that can return the minimum number from an array of integers

	4. finding min and max from array

	5. Write a program that can return the average number from user inputs
            ex: 
                [1,2,3] 
                average: 2

                [10, 15, 5, 6] 
                average: 9


3 Data Structures:
		1. Array
		2. Collection
		3. Map


Arrays Utility:

	Arrays class: in "java.util" package

			import PackageName.ClassName;
			import java.util.Arrays;


			Arrays.toString( array ): converts rhe array to String
									MUST use in order to print the entire array

			Arrays.sort(array): sorts the array in ascending order

					int[] arr = {9,4,2,1, 10, 11, 0};

							  {0, 1, 2, 4, 9, 10, 11}


			equals(arr1, arr2): returns boolean


String methods:
	
	toCharArray(): returns char array from string
			str = "abcd";

			str.toCharArray() ==> {'a', 'b', 'c', 'd'}

	split(strValue): returns String array, splits the string by given value

		str = "Today is great day";
		str.split(" "); ==> {"Today", "is", "great", "day" }






Task:
	1. write a program that cna sort an array of integers in descending

				int[] arr = {5,1,2,6,7, 0};

				output:
					7 6 5 2 1 0


					output:
						[7, 6, 5, 2, 1, 0]




	2. write a program that can check how many palindrome strings in the array


"Today is great day"


	3. reverse the sentence

		"I love learning java"  ==>  {I, love, learning, java}

		java learning love I

	4. count java
		"I like to learn java, because java is cool, and java is useful, javascript"


Take home assignment:
	5. print the unique words from an array of String

			String[] words = {"C#", "Java", "C#", "Python", "Python", "Ruby", "Swift", "C++", "Swift"}


			output:
				Java Ruby C++


	6. print out the longest words from an array of String

			String[] words = {"Monday", "Apple", "Banana", "Strawberry", "Programmin"};

			output:
				Strawberry Programmin


	7. write a program that can find the unique numbers from an integer array

			int[] arr ={1,2,3,1,2,4}

			output:
				3 4


topic: for each loop
