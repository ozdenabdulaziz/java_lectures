	plusday,month,year,hour, minutes

1. create string array to have 5 of your classmate's names
2. create an array that contains thier DofB 

	print: name : DofB


DateTimeFormatter: 

		LocalDate:
		    year: yyyy
		    month: MM (number), MMM(three letters of month), MMMM(full name)
		    days: dd
		    name of day: E(three letters) , EEEE (full name)

		LocalTime:
		    hours: hh
		    minutes: mm
		    seconds: ss

Data Structures:
		1. Array: supports both primitives and none primitives
		2. Collection: does not support primitives
		3. Map: does not support primitives


Wrapper class: Byte, Short, Integer, Long, Float, Double, Character, Boolean

				presensted in "java.lang" package.


 		Autoboxing: coverting primitives to wrapper class value
 		Unboxing: converting wrapper class value to primitives

Integer, Double,  Boolean, Character

 		methods:
 			1. parse methods: converting string to primitives
 						not case sensitive


 			2. valueOf methods: converting string to Wrapper class
 						not case sensitive
