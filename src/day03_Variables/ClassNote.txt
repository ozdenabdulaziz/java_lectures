Warmup tasks:

    1. create a package in "JavaProgramming2020_B21" project named: day03_Variables

    2. create a subfolder named "Day03" under "Java Programming 2020"
            go to canvas -> java -> modules -> day03  download the presentation and save it into the sub folder Day03

    3. create a class called EmployeeInfo:    
                    print:

Comments: giving notes to the codes. does not effect the actual codes


    single line comments: starts with //
                          only used for one single line


    multi line comments: used for multi line comments

                        /*

print statements:
        
        System.out.println(): appends new line at the end

        System.out.print(): does not append new line at the end


Escape Sequences: MUST be used in ""


    \n: Enter key, starts a new line
    \t: Tab Key, starts a paragraph space
    \\: back slash
    \': single quote
    ': single quote
    \": double quote
	\"   \"


Task:

    1. create a class called AboutMySelf
            write a paragraph to tell us about your self
                Must include:
                        favorite music
                        book
                        TV series



Variable: make the data reusable.
		
		devlare variables:
			DataType name = Data;

				DataType decides what data can be stored variables name

Promitives dataType:	byte, short, int, long, float, double, char, boolean

						Numerical primitives: byte, short, int, ling, float, double
											
											double > float > long > int > short > byte

						Integer numbers (whole number): byte, short, int, long
															(int is prefered)

						decimal numbers: float, double

						char:
							a, b, !, $, 1, 2, 3

					boolean:
					 	10 < 9 ===> incorrect ===> false
						10 > 9 ===> correct ===> true
									maybe 



									
									
Task:
	1.	write a program that can calulate the area & perimeter of ant rectangele that has inter number
						
	2.	write a program that can calculate the area and permeter of the square that has integer values
			A = side * side
			p = side * 4

			int side = 10;

			int area = side * side;
			
			int perimeter =	side * 4;

			System.out.println( area );
			System.out.println( perimeter );

	3. Circle
			A = radius * radius * PI;
			P = 2 * radius * PI;

			double radius = 4.5;
			double PI = 3.14;

			double area = radius * radius * PI;
			double perimeter = radius * 2 * PI;
