warmup task
	1. use swithc statement to write a program that can return the number of days based on the name of the month

	Ex:

		month = Mar;

		output:
			31 days


		year = 2020;
		month = Feb;

		DaysInMonth




		result: 28, 29, 30, 31, invalid

		cases: 2 ==> 28 or 29 days
		cases: 4,6,9,11 ==> 30 days
		cases: 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12 ==> 31 days
		default: Invalid

		|| we cannot use in the switch or case, but we can apply or logic in switch by declaring the cases back to back without break statement

if statement without curly braces: if blocks contains one statement ONLY

								Not a good behavior



Reveiw topics:
		1. If statement: boolean
				if & else statement: for 2 options/possibilities (not less not more than 2)

							if(Condition){
									A
							}else{
									B
							}


				multi-branch if statement: for 3 or more options/possibitiles. else if block

							if(Condition1){
								A;
							}else if(Condition2){
								B;
							}else if(condition3){
								C;
							}
							.....
							else{
								D;
							}

							ONLY one block gets executed
							the first true condition will get executed



				nested if statement: for pre-condition that can be evaluate to different secarios

						if(Pre- Condition){

							if(condition1){
							    A;  
							}else if(Condition2){
								B;
							}else{
								C;
							}

						} else {

							D;

						}

					A: precondition MUST be true, Condition1 is true
					B: precondition MUST be true, condition1 is false and Condition2 is true
					C: precondition MUST be true, condition1 & condition2 are false
					D: precondition MUST be false


		2. Teranry: MUST return value
					? if
					: else


					if(Condition)
					(condition)?

				TOTAL NUMBER OF ? MUST BE EQUAL TO TOTAL NUMBER OF :
				() FOR THE CONDITION IS OPTIONAL
