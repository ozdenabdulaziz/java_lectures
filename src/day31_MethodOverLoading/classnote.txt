		Method Overloading

package name: day31_MethodOverLoading

class starts at: 10:05 am

warmup tasks:
	Task1:
		1.  write a return method called frequencyOfWord that accepts two parameters: string str and String word, then returns the frequency of word
				Ex:
					str = "Java java java python python"
					word = "java";

					frequencyOfWord(str, word) ==>  3


	Task2:
		1. create a method that can find the addition of two numbers
					method name: additionOf2Numbers

		2. create a method that can find the addition of three numbers
			        method name: additionOf3Numbers

		3. create a method that can find the addition of four numbers
					method name: additionOf4Numbers


Method Overloading: multiple methods sharing the same name

					Parameters MUST BE DIFFERENT (either data type or number of parameters)

					SAME METHOD NAME DIFFERENT PARAMETERS

					return does not matter (can be same or different)

					advantage:
							1. easy to remember
							2. easy to read
							3. reusuable
							4. flexible
