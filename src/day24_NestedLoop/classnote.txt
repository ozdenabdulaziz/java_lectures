Package name: day24_NestedLoop


Warmup tasks:
    1. write a program that ill ask user to enter two numbers and calculates the sum of those two numbers. then it asks the user if he/she wants to continue
                    if the answer is yes, repeat the whole process again
                    if the answer is no, only return the addition
                    but while the anser is neither yes or no, the the program should repeatedly ask the user re-enter

            HINT: nested loop task, outter loop need to be an infinite loop


    2. write a program for the room reservation:
            King Bed ==> 120$
            Queen Bed ==> 100$
            single Bed ==> 80$

            the program asks the user which bedroom does he/she wants to reserve and calculats the total price, and then the program will ask:
                do you want to reserve another room:
                            if yes ==> repeat the previous steps
                            if no ==> your total price is: $$$
                            while answer is neither yes or no ==> please re-enter

            HINT: nested loop task, outter loop need to be an infinite loop


    3. write a program that can find the unique characters from a string
    		Ex:
    			 str = "AABCCD";

    			 output:
    			 		BD


	 		approach:
	 				find the frequncy of each character one by one, and if the frequency of the character is equal to 1, it means it's unique

			 In previous section we leaned how to find the frequency of one character. you will need to repeat the same steps
