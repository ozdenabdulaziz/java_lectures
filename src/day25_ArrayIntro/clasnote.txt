Package name: day25_ArrayIntro

Data Structures: to use the data effeciently, organize the data
	1. Array
	2. Collection
	3. Map



variable: 
		
		DataType  name = data;

		int number = 100;



Array variable: a variable that can have multiple data
		

	declare array:
		DataType[] arrayName = {data1, data2, data3... };


	initializing the size only:
		DataType[] arrayName = new  DataType[length];

		String[] students = new String[10];

		ARRAY' SIZE IS FIXED

	length ==> total number of elemnts
	leight -1 ==> max index



task:
	write a program that can find the maximum and minimum number for an array of integer



come back at: 2:10 pm



Tasks:
	Calculator
	1. Addiition, subctraction, multiplication, devision, remainder

		would you like to continue? Yes, No



	2. write a program for the room reservation:
		   A, King Bed ==> 120$
		   B,  Queen Bed ==> 100$
		   C,  single Bed ==> 80$
    the program asks the user which bedroom does he/she wants to reserve and calculates the total price, and then the program will ask:
        do you want to reserve another room:
                    if yes ==> repeat the previous steps
                    if no ==> your total price is: $$$
                    while answer is neither yes or no ==> please re-enter
    HINT: nested loop task, outer loop need to be an infinite loop



    3. unique chars
    		only occured once


	4. remove the unique characters from string

			str = "abcabd";

			output:
				abab



Assignments:
	1. write a program that can find the frequency of each characters from a string

			str = "ababcaa";

					// nonDup =  "abc"  a b c
					  //     frequency: 4 2 1

			output:
				a4b2c1
